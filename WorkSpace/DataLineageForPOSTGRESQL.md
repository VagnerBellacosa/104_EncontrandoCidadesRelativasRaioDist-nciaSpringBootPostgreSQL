# DATA LINEAGE FOR POSTGRESQL

PostgreSQL is a frequently-used open source object-relational SQL database system. There are different new technologies that are built on PostgreSQL right now – such as [**Amazon Redshift**](https://getmanta.com/scanners-and-integrations/amazon-redshift/) and [**Greenplum**](https://getmanta.com/scanners-and-integrations/greenplum/). MANTA’s engineering team has developed a connector that supports these technologies with our scanners, so transformations written in PostgreSQL can become part of your data governance solution.
